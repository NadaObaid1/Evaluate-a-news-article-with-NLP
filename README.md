### Evaluate-a-News-Article-With-NLP:

Evaluate-a-News-Article-With-NLP is a project designed to analyze and evaluate news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
This application allows users to input a news article and receive a detailed evaluation of the content, including sentiment analysis, confidence in the analysis, subjectivity, agreement, and any potential irony.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage:
Open the application in your web browser.
Enter the news article text in the designated input field.
Click the evaluate button to view the analysis results.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technologies Used:
JavaScript: The primary programming language used to build the application.
Jest: A testing framework used to ensure code quality.
HTML/CSS: For designing and styling the user interface

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main Tools: 
1. Webpack Entry: 
Webpack is going to make a map of our app assets and all of their dependencies, but it needs somewhere to start. That entry point is Webpack entry.

2. Loaders: 
Loaders allow us to transform files of one type into another type so that Webpack can work with them

3. Plugins: 
While loaders are used to transform certain types of modules, plugins can be leveraged to perform a wider range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management, and injection of environment variables.

4. Mode: 
One of the awesome features of Webpack, is that it lets us apply configurations to our code based on the environment we are running. We can create a development environment (MODE in Webpack) and run totally different loaders and plugins than we do for production mode
